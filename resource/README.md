# Microservices Architecture with OAuth2-Based Resource Server
This architecture consists of **Authorization Server**, **Gateway**, **Discovery Service**, and **Resource Server**, with the latter being the microservices themselves. By using OAuth2, the architecture ensures **Secure Communication** between services.

**Key Benefits:**
*   **Secure Microservice**: Only authorized clients have access, reducing the attack surface.
*   **Decoupling Concerns**: OAuth2 handles authentication and authorization, allowing focus on core functionality.
